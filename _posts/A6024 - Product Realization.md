# <a name="description">Objectives</a>

  Making the students socially responsible is the main motto. In this process introducing technological concepts and creating innovating product is carried out for the community. The Product Realization introduces communication with community, planning of product realization, design and development of the product added with skill sets of leadership. This course given an exposure on converting an innovative idea to physical product to meet the need of the community. It improves skill of research paper writing, patent drafting and also developing the skill of preparation of business models.

# Coursework

Inform the instructor any time *prior* to the due date for an assignment that you wish to use a late day; you may then turn in the assignment up to 24
hours late. Multiple late days may be used on the same assignment. There are no partial late days; turning in an assignment 2 hours late or 20 hours late will
both use 1 late day. Note that late days are intended to cover both normal circumstances (you simply want more time to work on the assignment) and exceptional circumstances. The late assignments will receive at most half credit.
