# <a name="description">Objectives</a>

  This is a core subject for electrical and electronics engineering students of third Year. The objective is to make them familiar with various power electronic switches and converter circuits. This course deals with operation of various power electronic devices like SCR, IGBT, MOSFET, etc. Also, this course mainly emphasizes on basic power electronic converter circuits such as Phase controlled rectifiers, Choppers, AC voltage controllers,Cyclo-converters and Inverters.

# Coursework

Inform the instructor any time *prior* to the due date for an assignment that you wish to use a late day; you may then turn in the assignment up to 24 hours late. Multiple late days may be used on the same assignment. There are no partial late days; turning in an assignment 2 hours late or 20 hours late will both use 1 late day. Note that late days are intended to cover both normal circumstances (you simply want more time to work on the assignment) and exceptional circumstances. The late assignments will receive at most half credit.
